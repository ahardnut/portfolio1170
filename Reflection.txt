The website I created for this assignment serves as an example of my skills and knowledge from the semester. When I consider it in light of my expectations as stated in A1, I see both places where I am satisfied and where I have room to grow.
The website satisfies most of the requirements in terms of meeting the essential standards listed in A1. It has a grid layout, many pages with navigation, interactive elements including form submissions and JavaScript functionality, and responsive design elements. These components show proficiency with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and are in line with the fundamental concepts of the course.
Nevertheless, a few aspects of the website don't live up to my early expectations. One area that can use improvement is visual design. The website is functional, however it doesn't have the polished, businesslike appearance I had in mind. A more logical and eye-catching design might be achieved by tweaking the color scheme, typeface, and general arrangement. Additionally, the pictures that are used can be more intriguing and suitable for the theme and content of the website.
Additionally, the website's material can be more comprehensive and educational. It should serve as an excellent portfolio website, showcasing my projects, abilities, and knowledge. The website could use additional in-depth project displays, testimonials, and a thorough rundown of my talents and certifications, even though it already has the essentials like project descriptions and contact details.
Even with these shortcomings, I think the website still has promise and, with more work and modification, may be utilized for the goal mentioned in A1. If the website's design, content, and functionality are given more thought, it might be a useful tool for me to market my abilities and draw in business chances in the web development industry.
In the future, I want to keep improving and upgrading the website to make it more in line with my objectives. This might entail doing usability testing, getting input from mentors and peers, and devoting time and energy to continuous development. I have faith that I can build a portfolio website that successfully showcases my abilities and advances my career by utilizing the knowledge and abilities I've acquired from this course.
